This file documents problems you may encounter when upgrading django-treebeard
(potential backward incompatible changes).

20081117:

    Cleaned __init__.py, if you need Node you'll have to call it from it's
    original location (treebeard.models.Node instead of treebeard.Node). Also
    exceptions have been moved to treebeard.exceptions.



20100316:

    Queryset ordering in NS/MP trees is now enforced by the library. Previous
    ordering settings in META no longer work.
