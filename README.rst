Wagtail CMS
===========

Wagtail is a Django content management system built originally for the `Royal College of Art <http://www.rca.ac.uk/>`_ and focused on flexibility and user experience. Its features include:

* A fast, attractive editor interface
* Complete control over design with standard Django templates
* Configure content types through standard Django models
* Tightly integrated search (with an `Elasticsearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org/>`_ backend for production)
* Strong document and image management
* Wide support for embedded content
* Simple, configurable permissions
* Support for tree-based content organisation
* Optional preview->submit->approve workflow
* Fast out of the box. `Varnish <https://www.varnish-cache.org/>`_-friendly if you need it
* Tests! But not enough; we're working hard to improve this

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get you up and running quickly, we've provided a demonstration site with all the configuration in place, at `github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo/>`_; see the `README <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo/blob/master/README.md>`_ for installation instructions. `Serafeim Papastefanos <https://github.com/spapas>`_ has kindly written a `tutorial <https://gist.github.com/tomdyson/8974456>`_ with all the steps to build a simple Wagtail site from scratch.

Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're a Python or Django developer, fork the repo and get stuck in! Send us a useful pull request and we'll post you a `t-shirt <https://twitter.com/WagtailCMS/status/432166799464210432/photo/1>`_. Our immediate priorities are better docs, more tests, internationalisation and localisation.
