 * More and better tests (>80% `coverage <https://coveralls.io/r/torchbox/wagtail>`_)
 * Better documentation: simple setup guides for all levels of user, a manual for editors and administrators, in-depth intstructions for Django developers.
 * A form builder
 * Move site section permissions out of Django admin
 * Improved image handling: intelligent cropping, animated gif support
 * Block-level editing UI (see `Sir Trevor <http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/>`_)
 * Site settings management
 * Edit bird for logged-in visitors
