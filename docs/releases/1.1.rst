What's new
==========

``specific()`` method on PageQuerySet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually, an operation that retrieves a queryset of pages (such as ``homepage.get_children()``) will return them as basic Page instances, which only include the core page data such as title. The ``specific()`` method (e.g. ``homepage.get_children().specific()``) now allows them to be retrieved as their most specific type, using the minimum number of queries.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Implemented pagination in the page chooser modal
 * Changed INSTALLED_APPS in project template to list apps in precedence order
 * The ``{% image %}`` tag now supports filters on the image variable, e.g. ``{% image primary_img|default:secondary_img width-500 %}``
 * Moved the style guide menu item into the Settings sub-menu
 * Search backends can now be specified by module (e.g. ``wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch``), rather than a specific class (``wagtail.wagtailsearch.backends.elasticsearch.ElasticSearch``)
 * Added ``descendant_of`` filter to the API
 * Added optional directory argument to "wagtail start" command
 * Non-superusers can now view/edit/delete sites if they have the correct permissions
 * Image file size is now stored in the database, to avoid unnecessary filesystem lookups
 * Updated URLs within the admin backend to use namespaces

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Text areas in the non-default tab of the page editor now resize to the correct height
 * Tabs in "insert link" modal in the rich text editor no longer disappear (Tim Heap)
 * H2 elements in rich text fields were accidentally given a click() binding when put insite a collapsible multi field panel
