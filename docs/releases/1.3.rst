Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The default ``src``, ``width``, ``height`` and ``alt`` attributes can now be overridden by attributes passed to the ``{% image %}`` tag
 * Added keyboard shortcuts for preview and save in the page editor
 * Added ``Page`` methods ``can_exist_under``, ``can_create_at``, ``can_move_to`` for customising page type business rules

 * Site records now implement ``get_by_natural_key``
 * Creating pages at the root level (and any other instances of the base ``Page`` model) now properly respects the `parent_page_types` setting

 * ``subpage_types`` / ``parent_page_types`` business rules are now enforced when moving pages
 * Multi-word tags on images and documents are now correctly preserved as a single tag (LKozlowski)


Upgrade considerations
======================

ContentType-returning methods in wagtailcore are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following internal functions and methods in ``wagtail.wagtailcore.models``, which return a list of ``ContentType`` objects, have been deprecated. Any uses of these in your code should be replaced by the corresponding new function which returns a list of model classes instead:

 * ``get_page_types()`` - replaced by ``get_page_models()``
 * ``Page.clean_subpage_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.clean_subpage_models()``
 * ``Page.clean_parent_page_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.clean_parent_page_models()``
 * ``Page.allowed_parent_page_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.allowed_parent_page_models()``
 * ``Page.allowed_subpage_types()`` - replaced by ``Page.allowed_subpage_models()``

In addition, note that these methods now return page types that are marked as ``is_creatable = False``, including the base ``Page`` class. (Abstract models are not included, as before.)
