What's new
==========


Custom document models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Document` model can now be overridden using the new `WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_MODEL` setting. This works in the same way that `WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL` works for `Image`.

Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Date/time pickers now respect the locale's 'first day of week' setting (Peter Quade)
 * Refactored the way forms are constructed for the page editor, to allow custom forms to be used


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Custom page managers no longer raise an error when used on an abstract model
 * Wagtail's migrations are now all reversible (benjaoming)
 * Deleting a page content type now preserves existing pages as basic Page instances, to prevent tree corruption
 * The ``Page.path`` field is now explicitly given the "C" collation on PostgreSQL to prevent tree ordering issues when using a database created with the Slovak locale
 * Wagtail's compiled static assets are now put into the correct directory on Windows (Aarni Koskela)
 * ``ChooserBlock`` now correctly handles models with primary keys other than ``id`` (alexpilot11)
 * Fixed typo in Wistia oEmbed pattern (Josh Hurd)
 * Added more accurate help text for the Administrator flag on user accounts (Matt Fozard)
