What's new
==========

New interface for choosing images focal point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The ``content_type`` template filter has been removed from the project template, as the same thing can be accomplished with ``self.get_verbose_name|slugify``.
 * Page copy operations now also copy the page revision history.
 * Page models now support a ``parent_page_types`` property in addition to ``subpage types``, to restrict the types of page they can be created under.
 * ``register_snippet`` can now be invoked as a decorator.
 * The project template (used when running ``wagtail start``) has been updated to Django 1.7.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * The 'wagtail start' command now works on Windows and other environments where the ``django-admin.py`` executable is not readily accessible.
 * The external image URL generator no longer stores generated images in Django's cache; this was an unintentional side-effect of setting cache control headers.
