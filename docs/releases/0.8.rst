What's new
==========



Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Signal handlers for ``wagtail.wagtailsearch`` and ``wagtail.contrib.wagtailfrontendcache`` are now automatically registered when using Django 1.7 or above.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Replaced references of .username with .get_username() on users for better custom user model support


Upgrade considerations
======================

Automatic registration of signal handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Signal handlers for the ``wagtailsearch`` core app and ``wagtailfrontendcache`` contrib app are automatically registered. Calls to ``register_signal_handlers`` from your ``urls.py`` can be removed.
