Upgrade considerations
======================

Automatic registration of signal handlers (Django 1.7+)

Signal handlers for the ``wagtailsearch`` core app and ``wagtailfrontendcache`` contrib app are automatically registered when using Django 1.7. Calls to ``register_signal_handlers`` from your ``urls.py`` can be removed.
