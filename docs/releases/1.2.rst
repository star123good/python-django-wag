What's new
==========

Jinja2 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core templatetags (``pageurl``, ``slugurl``, ``image``, ``richtext`` and ``wagtailuserbar``) are now compatible with Jinja2 so it's now possible to use Jinja2 as the template engine for your Wagtail site.

See: :doc:`/advanced_topics/jinja2`


Improved search mechanism for images and documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail's image and document models now provide a ``search`` method on their QuerySets, making it easy to perform searches on filtered data sets.

See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_images_documents_custom_models`


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * WagtailRedirectMiddleware can now ignore the query string if there is no redirect that exactly matches it
 * Order of URL parameters now ignored by redirect middleware
 * Added SQL Server compatibility to image migration
 * Added classnames to Wagtail rich text editor buttons to aid custom styling
 * Simplified body_class in default homepage template
 * page_published signal now called with the revision object that was published
 * Added a favicon to the admin interface, customisable by overriding the ``branding_favicon`` block (see :ref:`custom_branding`).
 * Added spinner animations to long-running form submissions
 * The EMBEDLY_KEY setting has been renamed to WAGTAILEMBEDS_EMBEDLY_KEY

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Deleting a page permission from the groups admin UI does not immediately submit the form
 * Wagtail userbar is shown on pages that do not pass a ``page`` variable to the template (e.g. because they override the ``serve`` method)
 * ``request.site`` now set correctly on page preview when the page is not in the default site
 * Project template no longer raises a deprecation warning (Maximilian Stauss)


Upgrade considerations
======================

``Image.search`` and ``Document.search`` methods are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Image.search`` and ``Document.search`` methods have been deprecated in favour of the new QuerySet-based search mechanism - see :ref:`wagtailsearch_images_documents_custom_models`. Code using the old ``search`` methods should be updated to search on QuerySets instead; for example:

.. code-block:: python

    Image.search("Hello", filters={'uploaded_by_user': user})

can be rewritten as:

.. code-block:: python

    Image.objects.filter(uploaded_by_user=user).search("Hello")
