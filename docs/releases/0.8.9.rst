What's changed
==============

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* When copying a page, IDs of child objects within page revision records were not remapped to the new objects; this would cause those objects to be lost from the original page when editing the new one
* Search no longer crashes when auto-indexing a model that doesn't have an id field (Scot Hacker)
