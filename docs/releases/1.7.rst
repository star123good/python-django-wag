What's new
==========


Elasticsearch 2 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail now supports Elasticsearch 2. Note that you need to change backend in ``WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS``, if you wish to switch to Elasticsearch 2. This feature was developed by Karl Hobley.

See: :ref:`wagtailsearch_backends_elasticsearch`


AWS CloudFront support added to cache invalidation module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail's cache invalidation module can now invalidate pages cached in AWS CloudFront when they are updated or unpublished.
This feature was developed by Rob Moorman.

See: :ref:`frontendcache_aws_cloudfront`


Unpublishing subpages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unpublishing a page now gives the option to unpublish its subpages at the same time. This feature was developed by Jordi Joan.


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * The ``|embed`` filter has been converted into a templatetag ``{% embed %}`` (Janneke Janssen)
 * The ``wagtailforms`` module now provides a ``FormSubmissionPanel`` for displaying details of form submissions; see :ref:`wagtailforms_formsubmissionpanel` for documentation. (João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * The Wagtail version number can now be obtained as a tuple using ``from wagtail import VERSION`` (Tim Heap)
 * ``send_mail`` logic has been moved from ``AbstractEmailForm.process_form_submission`` into ``AbstractEmailForm.send_mail``. Now it's easier to override this logic (Tim Leguijt)
 * Added ``before_create_page``, ``before_edit_page``, ``before_delete_page`` hooks (Karl Hobley)
 * Updated font sizes and colours to improve legibility of admin menu and buttons (Stein Strindhaug)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Migrations for wagtailcore and project template are now reversible (Benjamin Bach)
 * The default image format label text ('Full width', 'Left-aligned', 'Right-aligned') is now localised (Mikalai Radchuk)
 * Text on the front-end 'password required' form is now marked for translation (Janneke Janssen)
 * Text on the page view restriction form is now marked for translation (Luiz Boaretto)
 * Fixed toggle behaviour of userbar on mobile (Robert Rollins)
 * Image rendition / document file deletion now happens on a post_delete signal, so that files are not lost if the deletion does not proceed (Janneke Janssen)
 * "Your recent edits" list on dashboard no longer leaves out pages that another user has subsequently edited (Michael Cordover, Kees Hink, João Luiz Lorencetti)
 * ``InlinePanel`` now accepts a ``classname`` parameter as per the documentation (emg36, Matt Westcott)
 * Disabled use of escape key to revert content of rich text fields, which could cause accidental data loss (Matt Westcott)


Upgrade considerations
======================

.. _filter_spec_migration:

Custom image models require a data migration for the new ``filter_spec`` field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data model for image renditions will be changed in Wagtail 1.8 to eliminate ``Filter`` as a model. Wagtail sites using a custom image model (see :ref:`custom_image_model`) need to have a schema and data migration in place prior to upgrading to Wagtail 1.8. To create these migrations:

 * Run ``manage.py makemigrations`` to create the schema migration
 * Run ``manage.py makemigrations --empty myapp`` (replacing ``myapp`` with the name of the app containing the custom image model) to create an empty migration
 * Edit the created migration to contain::

    from wagtail.wagtailimages.utils import get_fill_filter_spec_migrations

   and, for the ``operations`` list::

    forward, reverse = get_fill_filter_spec_migrations('myapp', 'CustomRendition')
    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(forward, reverse),
    ]

   replacing ``myapp`` and ``CustomRendition`` with the app and model name for the custom rendition model.
