What's new
==========


New page privacy options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously users with publishing permissions were able to restrict access to a page based on a shared password. Now they can also restrict access to logged-in users only, or to users from specific groups. This feature was developed by Shawn Makinson, Tom Miller, Luca Perico and Matt Westcott.

See: :ref:`private_pages`


Minor features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Added support of a custom ``edit_handler`` for site settings. See :ref:`docs for the site settings module <edit_handlers_settings>`. (Axel Haustant)
 * Added ``get_landing_page_template`` getter method to ``AbstractForm`` (Gagaro)
 * Added ``Page.get_admin_display_title`` method to override how the title is displayed in the admin (Henk-Jan van Hasselaar)
 * Added support for specifying custom HTML attributes for table rows on ModelAdmin index pages. See :ref:`modeladmin_get_extra_attrs_for_row` (Andy Babic)
 * Added ``first_common_ancestor`` method to ``PageQuerySet`` (Tim Heap)
 * Page chooser now opens at the deepest ancestor page that covers all the pages of the required page type (Tim Heap)
 * ``PageChooserBlock`` now accepts a ``target_model`` option to specify the required page type (Tim Heap)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * ``AbstractForm`` now respects custom ``get_template`` methods on the page model (Gagaro)
 * Use specific page model for the parent page in the explore index (Gagaro)
 * Remove responsive styles in embed when there is no ratio available (Gagaro)
 * Parent page link in page search modal no longer disappears on hover (Dan Braghis)
 * ModelAdmin views now consistently call ``get_context_data`` (Andy Babic)
 * Header for search results on the redirects index page now shows the correct count when the listing is paginated (Nick Smith)
 * ``set_url_paths`` management command is now compatible with Django 1.10 (Benjamin Bach)
 * Form builder email notifications now output multiple values correctly (Sævar Öfjörð Magnússon)
 * Closing 'more' dropdown on explorer no longer jumps to the top of the page (Ducky)

Upgrade considerations
======================

``wagtail.wagtailimages.models.get_image_model`` has moved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``get_image_model`` function should now be imported from ``wagtail.wagtailimages`` rather than ``wagtail.wagtailimages.models``. See :ref:`custom_image_model_referring_to_image_model`.
