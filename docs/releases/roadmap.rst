The story so far
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wagtail was developed for the Royal College of Art in 2013, and launched as an open source project in February 2014. The changes since its launch are recorded in the codebase:

In summary:

 * February 2014: Reduced dependencies, basic documentation, translations, tests

What's next
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `issue list <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail/issues>`_ gives a detailed view of the immediate tasks, but our current broad priorities are:

 * Better documentation: simple setup guides for all levels of user, a manual for editors and administrators, in-depth intstructions for Django developers.
 * Block-level editing UI (see `Sir Trevor <http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/>`_)
 * Support for an HTML content type
 * Simple inline stats
