Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * Added missing jQuery UI sprite files, causing collectstatic to throw errors (most reported on Heroku)
 * Page system check for on_delete actions of ForeignKeys was throwing false positives when page class decends from an abstract class (Alejandro Giacometti)
 * Fixed a regression where form builder submissions containing a number field would fail with a JSON serialisation error
 * Resizing an image with a focal point equal to the image size would result in a divide-by-zero error
