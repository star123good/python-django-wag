Sites
=====

Wagtail allows mapping a "site" (hostname or domain) to any node in the tree, using that node as the site's root. See :ref:`pages-theory`.

Access this by going to "Settings" and then "Sites". To try out a development site, add a single site with the hostname ``localhost`` at port ``8000`` and map it to one of the pieces of content you have created.
