Demo site

To create a new site on Wagtail we recommend the ``wagtail start`` command in :doc:`creating_your_project`, however a demo site exists containing example page types and models. The demo site is also our recommended basis for contributing to Wagtail itself.

The repo and installation instructions can be found here: `https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo>`_
